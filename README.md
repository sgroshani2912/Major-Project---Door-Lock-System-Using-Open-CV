# Major Project - Door Lock System Using Open CV and Raspberry pi

## Hello visitors !
This is a project on door lock system using Open CV and raspberry pi. The realtime database of the system is hosted on google firebase. 
I'll highlight the key milestones I've achieved and the challenges I've overcome.

## Milestones and Progress

### Problem Statement and Initial Challenges (Video 1)
I began by addressing the problem statement of creating an Automated Door Locking System using Face Recognition. During my initial testing on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ with 1GB RAM, I encountered processing power limitations. This challenge led me to explore alternatives for a more efficient solution.

### Solenoid Lock Testing (Video 2)
To ensure the mechanical aspects of the system functioned properly, I conducted tests on the solenoid lock. I verified the latching and unlatching mechanisms using a push-button switch. Additionally, I mounted the lock on L-brackets provided by the workshop, which will eventually be used to install the lock onto the door frame.

### Face Recognition Code Testing (Video 3)
My face recognition algorithm was put to the test on my personal laptop. I achieved a promising accuracy rate of 90%. This validated the effectiveness of the algorithm and gave me confidence in its potential for integration.

### Transition to Raspberry Pi 4 Model (Video 4)
I transitioned our codebase to a Raspberry Pi 4 Model with 8GB of RAM, which significantly improved processing power. After successful face recognition tests on the Pi 4, I seamlessly integrated the solenoid lock code. This integration allowed me to test the entire system end-to-end.

### Video 4 Details
In Video 4, I demonstrate the capabilities of our system:

Person 1: Successfully registered in the database. The system recognizes their face and unlatches the lock, granting access.

Person 2: Not registered in the database. The system denies access and keeps the lock latched.
I've also incorporated an internal switch within the lab for users inside to conveniently unlock the door.
